                pseudocode!!! I never knew how much of it was needed for a large scale project or just any code related project. It so incredibly important to the development process.
                pseudocode is like the blueprints to a house. Without the blueprints there would be no house.

            <p class="my-4 ps-3 ">
                Good code is effective code and effective code is code that can be dynamic. Having the ability to add on functions without the process being broken.

            A good Developer keeps on learning and doesn't just stay stagnant. A developer should always make sure their code is effective and not sloppy.

               I would say programers hate talking to customers that don't know what can and can't be done on a project.

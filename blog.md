<!--  question #1  -->
  
  ## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
 
<!-- answer #1 -->
  
 My first week in the **Awesome Inc Bootcamp** was not as I expected

 - I did not expect [Github](https://github.com/) to be this big and vast (having a blast learning it)!
 - Did not realize there was this much more than just coding in a Developers world :flushed:.


<!-- question #2 -->
## What are you excited or eager to learn more about? 

<!-- answer #2 -->
- Would love to learn more frameworks (react, django, and flutter)!
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python!


<!-- question #3 -->
## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? 

<!-- answer #3 -->
 Well one thing that you could only learn from here is that the [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) World Championship actually had more viewers than the Super Bowl in 2019. The LOL World Championship reached 120 million viewers and the Super Bowl at that time had 108 million! It just goes to show how much esports has grown and will continue to grow! 

## Sidenote
This is a little something I did while in the "Intro to Web" class [pokemon generator](https://finalprojectvtwo.glitch.me/)

<!--  question #1  -->
  <h2 align="center"> 
  Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
  </h2>
<!-- answer #1 -->
  
<h3> My first week in the <b> Awesome Inc Bootcamp </b> was not as I expected </h3>

 - I did not expect [Github](https://github.com/) to be this big and vast (having a blast learning it)!
 - Did not realize there was this much more than just coding in a Developers world :flushed:.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- question #2 -->
<h2 align="center"> What are you excited or eager to learn more about? </h2>

<!-- answer #2 -->
- Would love to learn more frameworks (react, django, and flutter)!
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python!

<h2 align="center"> What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? </h2>
